# Product-Classification
🧠 Product Classification (AI Engineer Assessment – Payever GmbH)

This project was part of my AI Engineer recruitment assessment for Payever GmbH, where I was asked to classify products into self-defined categories such as House, Gaming, and Healthcare.
To approach this challenge, I built a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network using TensorFlow and Keras in Python 3.

🎯 Objective

Design and train a neural network model capable of classifying products into predefined categories, using the Adam optimizer and training for 12 epochs.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3

TensorFlow

Keras

📊 Results

The model achieved nearly 100% accuracy, mainly due to dataset limitations—the same data was used for both training and testing. While the results reflected overfitting, the task demonstrated my ability to implement and fine-tune neural networks for product categorization.

💡 Reflection

This project deepened my understanding of model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of distinct datasets and realistic testing environments for reliable AI performance.
